= Emballage

Based on the concept {sported by GitHub}[http://github.com/blog/551-optimizing-asset-bundling-and-serving-with-rails], this plugin serves the purpose of making it much easier to package your JavaScript and CSS files together into "bundles", so that they are easy for your clients to download once and cache in their browsers. This is a recommended practice to increase performance of your Rails application dramatically.

Initial code from an old version of https://github.com/voxxit/assemblage.git
